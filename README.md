# Simple Todo App

### This website is an App that allows users to create and delete various tasks, assign due dates, and check off the tasks as the person completes them.

## Functionality

### Delving into the code, there is a template in the HTML coding formatted in a way to adjust to the user's display. This template is utilized by the Javascript code to design specific "tasks" created by the user's input, then add them to the HTML code as per the template format. The input of the task name is "validated" to insure there is content of at least two characters to avoid empty tasks, and the user may also input a date.

### The date can either be typed via the standard MM/DD/YYYY format or clicking an icon that brings a calendar visible. The calendar is formatted in a way that the user can click the specific day in the specific year, and there's a few ways this can be done including clicking a button labeled "today".

### The logo also adjusts it's position based on the user's display. The "+Add Todo" button adjusts it's position as well accordingly. Also, the "delete" display changes from text to an icon. The list now shows the total number of "todo" items as well as the number of items checked off as "completed." This adjusts based on adding or deleting "todo" items and if those items were checked off or not.

## Technology

### This application was created using various languages including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Some highlights of these languages are the various Javascript classes utilized to simplify the coding, exporting and importing those classes from separate files into a primary index.js file that is referenced as a "template", and constraints on the task description and due date inputs.
